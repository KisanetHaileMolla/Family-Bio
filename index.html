    <h2 > Introduction </h2>
    <p> My family has done everything for me, literally everything. They are kind people. Let alone imagining the violence of war, simple insults were not allowed when I was growing up. My brother would make me write out all the bad words I used and make me apologize to the person I said them to. It was hard at the time but it served me well in life.  

On religious holidays, my family would decorate our house and we would all go to church together. Later we would gather again at home, make coffee, eat derho. My sisters would make Siwa. We changed clothes and put on our festive dresses. The entire mood was one of joy and excitement. During these holidays and at weekends, my cousins would join us too.  They have done all they can for me to get here. I am so greatful for all they have done. My siblings did everything to make me feel like we had it all. They were kids without parents themselves but they took care of us. It always amazes me.’</p>

    <h3 id = "top"> Lalimey, Asef and Fre </h3>
    
    <p> These are the first 3 of the family. Lalimey is Civil Engineer, Asefey is a marchant and Freway is laweyer. But most of all, these 3 are the people that got my family here today. They have done, literally everything in there power to make sure we eat and get the life we wanted. We were a very low income family, but my sisters and brothers always made sure we had enough food – and that we kept up our grades at school. During my elementary shool Lalimey (my older brother) was at the university. He has always been a great example to me and our entire family. We all look up to him. He is humbler, very kind and rational. My two sisters Asef and Fre are simply amazing. </p>
